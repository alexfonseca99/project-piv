Computer Vision and Image Processing course project

3D scene reconstruction (point cloud representation) from a sequence of RGB-Depth images captured from different perspectives.

Techniques used include:
 1. Feature extraction (SIFT) and matching
 2. Outlier detection (RANSAC)
 3. Perspective matching/homography estimation
 4. Point cloud projection
